2. Refer to the [overview](https://aws-quickstart.github.io/quickstart-datastax-oss/#_overview) and ensure that the deployment is supported in your region. 
3. Use quick start [link](https://aws-quickstart.github.io/quickstart-datastax-oss/#_launch_the_quick_start) to launch Cassandra 4 cluster into an existing VPC or a new VPC.
